Azure provides a comprehensive suite of tools and services to monitor your cloud resources. These tools help you ensure your applications and infrastructure are running optimally, diagnose issues, and maintain security.

Key Monitoring Services in Azure
Azure Monitor

Purpose: Centralized service to monitor, analyze, and act on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.
Components:
Metrics: Real-time data on the performance and health of your resources.
Logs: Detailed data for deeper analysis and troubleshooting.
Features:
Alerts: Automated notifications based on predefined conditions.
Dashboards: Customizable views to visualize data.
Insights: Specialized monitoring for applications, virtual machines, containers, etc.
Azure Log Analytics

Purpose: Collect and analyze log data from various sources.
Features:
Log Queries: Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to retrieve and analyze log data.
Workspaces: Centralized locations for storing log data.
Application Insights

Purpose: Application performance management (APM) service.
Features:
Telemetry: Collects data on application performance and usage.
Diagnostics: Helps diagnose errors and performance issues.
Analytics: Advanced tools to analyze telemetry data.
Azure Service Health

Purpose: Provides personalized alerts and guidance when Azure service issues affect your resources.
Features:
Service Issues: Information about ongoing service issues.
Planned Maintenance: Notifications about upcoming maintenance events.
Health Advisories: Recommendations to improve the health of your resources.
Setting Up Monitoring
Configure Diagnostic Settings

Enable diagnostics and logging for your resources (e.g., VMs, databases, storage accounts).
Define where logs and metrics should be sent (e.g., Log Analytics workspace, Event Hub, Storage account).
Create and Configure Alerts

Define alert rules based on metrics or log data.
Set up action groups to specify how alerts are handled (e.g., email, SMS, webhook).
Use Metrics Explorer

Access and visualize metrics data to monitor the performance and health of your resources.
Create custom charts and pin them to dashboards.
Build and Customize Dashboards

Create dashboards to visualize and track key metrics and log data.
Share dashboards with team members to ensure everyone has access to important monitoring information.
Best Practices
Set Up Baseline Metrics and Alerts

Define normal performance baselines to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy states.
Create alerts to detect deviations from these baselines.
Regularly Review and Tune Alerts

Adjust alert thresholds and conditions to reduce false positives and ensure meaningful notifications.
Periodically review and update your monitoring configurations to adapt to changes in your environment.
Leverage Automation

Use Azure Automation or Azure Functions to automate responses to certain alerts (e.g., auto-scaling, restarting services).
Implement End-to-End Monitoring

Ensure comprehensive monitoring coverage by using a combination of Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and other relevant tools.
Monitor all layers of your applications, including infrastructure, application code, and user experience.
By leveraging Azure's monitoring capabilities, you can maintain visibility into the health and performance of your resources, proactively identify and address issues, and ensure the reliability and security of your applications and infrastructure.
